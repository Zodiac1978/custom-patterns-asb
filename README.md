## Documentation

This plugin uses the filter hook from the [Antispam Bee](https://github.com/pluginkollektiv/antispam-bee/) plugin which is explained in their [documentation](https://antispambee.pluginkollektiv.org/documentation/#antispam_bee_patterns).

## Why in this way and not in Antispam Bee?

I can decide for my blog/site that I want to ignore all @mail.ru addresses, but a Russian user would probably not find that so funny. A comment consisting of only two letters will be considered spam, because I had such spam on my blog. If your commenters like to comment with "OK" then you have a problem. I could list more examples. A general approach is not so easy and requires a lot of data and intuition. However, in my own blog I can do what I want and that's what this plugin is for. To try around and test patterns. If you can live with the new patterns, feel free to install the plugin.

## Contributing

I welcome new ideas for patterns (as an [issue](https://github.com/Zodiac1978/custom-patterns-asb/issues/new)) and of course pull requests with finished patterns.

Please make sure a pattern is necessary for your case. If you want to ban just one obvious spammy word you can sometimes also just use the WordPress blocklist feature from the discussion settings page.
